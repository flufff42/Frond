## A MongoDB Client for iOS

![Frond Banner](Assets/Header.png)

**Frond** is a [MongoDB](http://mongodb.com) client for iOS built around [MongoKitten](https://github.com/OpenKitten/MongoKitten).

## ⚠️ Work in Progress

Frond is still a young sapling and is missing a lot before it can be a fully usable MongoDB client.
Check the [issues](https://github.com/flufff42/Frond/issues) if you'd like to help out or report a problem.
